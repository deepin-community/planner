	* Backend migrated to the new e-d-s modules system

	* Backend now compiles inside Planner CVS module

	* Support for multiple projects open working

	* We start to use the main Changelog so this Changelog won't be
	updated.

	* Solved problems when editing the details for a Task. I was
	freeing the component in e_cal_backend_planner_get_object.
	I want to understand better the searching component code.

	* Time to review all the Testing to close the TODO for modifying.
	It is important to check for dates (start, end, due ...) and also
	to check the work Planner concept in Evolution.

	* Solved the duplication task when modifying a task. It was
	because we don't return correctly the old_object.

	* The main bug right now is lookup_component (cbplanner, comp_uid)
	doesn't return a good ECalComponent when editing the details for
	a task. We need also to check how the search of a object is done
	in order to optimize it.

	* Can modify tasks from evolution
	* More complete MrpTask<->ECalComponent conversion
	* Next targets: add and remove tasks
	* Problems: fails adding task. The UI shows to task when 
	modifying a task
