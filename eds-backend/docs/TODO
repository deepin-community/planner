Short time:

* Complete the Planner Task to ECalComponent conversion
* Playing with UI to see how a user will add a planner source. Think
about how database planner projects works.
* Make the backend writeable

Medium time:

* Create a Contact backend also to work also with resources
* Complete the backend: check all methods we need to implement
* Check timezones logic
* Put the backend in Planner CVS or in e-d-s CVS

Long time:

* Think about adding directly a source for a planner project that is
attached to an email.


1. Planner Task to ECal:

From evolution calendar you can see for a task:

1.1 Task

-- Basics --
Summary: Name in Planner

Classification (Public, Private and Confidential): Not this kind in Planner 
(Milestone and Fixed duration in Planner)

Group: Evolution group

Categories (gal categories): not in Planner

Description: Notes in Planner

-- Date and Time --

Due Date and Time with timezone: also in Planner

Start Date and Time with timezone: also in Planner


1.2 Status

Status (Not started, In progress, Completed, Cancelled): Cancell isn't in Planner
Percent complete: also in Planner
Priority: also in Planner
Date and Time completed: also in Planner
Webpage: not in Planner 


1.3 Assignment

This is mainly for add contacts to a meeting for the task,
not to assign resources to the task. This is my first impression
but after thinking in it a little more.

A resource can have:

Attendee: name of the resource in Planner
Type (Individual, Group, Resource, Room, Unknown): also in planner but different types
	We can map planner types work to Individual and material to Resource.
Role: Not in planner. I think Planner needs it.
RSVP: Not in planner.
Status: Not in planner.
