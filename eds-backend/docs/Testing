Test plan for Planner Evolution backend

1. Loading a Planner project

	1.1 Create a Planner project file and create a
	source in Evolution to use it

	1.2 Create a Planner project database and create a
	source in Evolution to use it

2. Adding tasks

	2.1. Create with Planner an empty file and open with Evo

	2.2. Create with Planner a file with 1 task empty T1

	2.3. Add a new T2 Task from Evolution

3. Modifying tasks

	3.1 Modify T1 summary from Evolution and check changes with Planner

	3.2 Modify T1 Planner Task note and check changes from Evolution

	3.3 Modify step by step all the fields in Evolution task properties
	and check them in Planner fields.

	3.4 Modify step by step all the fields in Planner Task properties
	and check them in Evolution fields.

4. Removing tasks

	4.1. Remove T2 Task from Evolution

	4.2 Remove T2 Task from Planner

5. Working with substasks

6. Working with resources

	6.1 Assign a resource R1 from Planner and check it in Evolution

	6.2 Assign a contact C1 from Evolution and check it in Planner

7. Scalability

	7.1 Create a Planner Project with 100 and 1000 tasks and try to use it
	from the Evolution backend

	7.2 Create a Planner task with 100 resources assigned an try to use
	it from Evolution

8. Two ways testing:

	When Planner task importer for Evolution is done, try to create a 
Planner Project P1 and save it to a file F1.

	Then from Planner import all the task from Evolution that the backend
see for the Project P1 and save them to a file F2.

	Compare F1 and F2.

9. Backend developming environment:

	9.1 Create in Planner CVS the environment to compile the backend

	9.2. Convert to e-d-s plugin the backend when it is possible
