Backend alpha4 testing:


1. Loading a Planner project

	1.1 Create a Planner project file and create a
	source in Evolution to use it: KO

	It seems will be easy adding a new List of tasks to
	Evolution for the Type planner, but currently, the Add
	button is disabled if you select this type.

	Very interesting that can change the refresh time for the
	tasks list. 

	1.2 Create a Planner project database and create a
	source in Evolution to use it: KO

	It could be so easy because in Planner knows the storage
	type from the URL.
