Work in 3.3 and 3.4 for the alpha7 release

3. Modifying tasks

	3.3 Modify step by step all the fields in Evolution task properties
	and check them in Planner fields:

	We create a new task from Evolution and test how it is saved to Planner
	all the Evolution fields:

	* Task summary "evo1": OK, task name in Planner
	* Check box completed for "evo1": OK
	
	Time to see not direct fields for task. I have tried to add columns to
	the view so I can see fields in the task view but evolution has crashed.
	Need to check it with the evo 2.0 packages.

	Next fields don't have a direct translation to Planner task. We can create
	custom properties in Planner in order to support them. If not, we will loose
	this information when we exit from Evo and the data is saved in a Planner file.
	* Classification: public/private/confidential
	* Group: something related to the source of data. No need to save it.
	* Categories: a String with category fields for Planner.
	Birthday, Business, Competition

	* Description "test evo1 task": KO, need to fix it, comp2task. 
	It works from planner to Evolution.

	Next fields are about timing. In Planner normally, tasks don't have a concrete
	start time and end time because we use the work or duration to fix the end date
	and the start day normally is as soon as possible. We can use the "Must start on"
	restriction to tasks so they start when evolution task say. In Evolution
	we can put the dates to "None" but this is an important data for the user. I
	think the best plan is to let planner manage dates freely and then, take the
	dates from Planner and show them in Evolution.

	* Due date (task tab)
	* Start date (task tab)
	* Date completed (status tab): doesn't have time zone selection.

	Finally:

	* Status: are translated to percent complete, so if this field is
	saved correctly in Planner, it is ok. The status cancelled can't be
	shown in planner for now.
	* Percent complete "95": OK
	* Priority: High, Normal, Low, Undefined are translated over numbers
	from 0 to 9.  If we use Normal in Planner we get "5". OK.
	* Web page: we need to add a custom property in Planner so we store
	the task URL. KO

	About the resources (Attendees):

	We will translate Evolution attendees in Planner resources.

	* Organizer: we will need a custom property for resources in Planner if
	we want to save this info.

	About each resource we need:
      
	* Atendee "a1": Resource name in Planner. KO 
	* Type: Individual, Group, Room, Resource, Unknown. In Planner we have
	right now Work and Material that could be mapped to Individual and
	Resource. But we will lost other categories and we can't do nothing about
	it. In any case, we don't save it right now. KO
	* Rol: We need a custom property in Planner if we plan to save it. KO
	* RSVP: We need a custom property in Planner if we plan to save it. KO
	* Status: We need a custom property in Planner if we plan to save it. KO

	We can derive a clear plan to work in this points. For the moment, in
	we need to add custom properties to Planner Resources (atendees), we won't
	do it for the 0.1 release. 

	The Task custom properties will be added:
	Classification and Categories. About the dates, Planner will manage them
	and evolution will only show them. ¿Could we make this field read only
	in evolution in some way? We will add also Web page.

	So the plan for next days is:

	- Add custom properties Classification, Categories and Web page to
	Planner task, and fill the fields with Evolution data.

	DONE, we need to hide these properties in the Task view in Planner.
       	planner-task-tree.c (2120)

	- All dates in Evolution (start, end and due) will be managed from
	Planner. We need to check if we can make this fields in Evolution
	read only. We need to think about other ways to manage dates, for 
	example, let the user force a start date and due date.

	DONE. Dates come from planner and changes in Evolution are ignored.
	Ideally, the fields must be read only.

	- Implement the save of fields in Planner data: task description, 
	all the custom properties and the resources.

	DONE.

	3.4 Modify step by step all the fields in Planner Task properties
	and check them in Evolution fields

	A Planner task has the next fields:
	
	* WBS: unique in a project and automatic identifier for a task
	Evolution UID could be the more similar concept to that. For the
	moment we don't touch it from Evolution.

	* Name: Evo summanry. OK
	* Work: Not in Evo. OK
	* Type: Milestone, Fixed Duration.
	This concepts aren't in Evo. Maybe the fixed duration task could be
	the default in Evo. Need to think more about it.
	* Duration: Not in Evo. OK
	* Complete: Complete in Evo. OK
	* Priority: Evo priority only 0-9. OK if we use the correct values in Planner.
	
	Task assigned resources are translated to attendee in Evolution. 
	We loose some resources information from Planner because 
	ECalComponentAttendee has fewer data than MrpResource.

	* Resources: OK

	
	* Predecessors: Not in Evo. OK
	* Notes: Evo task description. OK.

	From Evolution we don't have the relations between tasks.
